		<p align="center" style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:000000; padding: 1em;">This is a first-person shooter set in various locations during World War I. As players progress through the storyline, they assume the roles of fighter pilot, armor crewman, rebel fighter, and message runner in order to complete missions. Characters use rifles, pistols, machine guns, and grenades to kill enemy soldiers in frenetic, realistic combat. Battles are highlighted by frequent gunfire, cries of pain, and explosions. Some sequences depict enemies wielding flamethrowers; soldiers can be heard screaming while engulfed in flames. Players can also use knives or bayonets to stab enemies in stealth attacks. Splashes of blood can be seen when enemies are hit; one sequence depicts blood and corpses on a beach after a battle. The word “f**k” appears in the dialogue (ESRB.com).</p>
