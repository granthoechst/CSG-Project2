Players use machine guns, shotguns, sniper rifles, turrets, and grenades to kill aliens and soldiers in frenetic combat. Battles are highlighted by realistic gunfire, screams of pain, and large splashes of blood. Some weapons/attacks result in decapitation or dismemberment that leaves bloodstains and body parts on the ground. Some finishing moves depict intense acts of violence: players can use a chainsaw-like weapon to slice enemies' necks or bodies; players can stomp on enemies' heads until they break apart. The words “sh*t” and “a*shole” can be heard in the dialogue. (ESRB.com).</p>
